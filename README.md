This is a three-part project consisting of a landing page, a login page and a main homepage - a new take on Netflix as a whole using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.

The assets can be found: [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OeMF3nGzdJ0MYMEISOyQNLD2Ma6rm2a_?usp=sharing), [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ttnllr6Bpe_0C-9OfV_uKWiXVWQHWdkc/view) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rjxWOGrgOSiApJ-h7R9QQqMusU0VCGix/view).

## FAQ

**Now for my favourite, FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this to fit my needs?

Yeah! why of-course, that is why this is even published onto the internet.

#### Can I host this, if I can how?

Yes, you can! with my favourite Apache container, XAMPP! Since I have explained it 20 times, I'm not kidding, we can skip the explanation because you know the drill.

So! Here is a [download](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) to the server. XAMPP (of-course)! And if you are struggling about you can start hosting with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzucEZh4_no) (by MainlyWebStuff).

And if you truly trust your web skills, you can use this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (by Soeng Souy) to self-host a domain.
